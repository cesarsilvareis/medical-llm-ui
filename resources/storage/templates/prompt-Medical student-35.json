Please take a look at this assessment layout and the PROFILE of my medical students under consideration.\n\n### Assessment Layout ###\nThe test you will create will consist of interpreting a clinical case study and answering 12 related questions among 5 medical topics.\n\n#### Statement Sheet Structure ####\nThe evaluation format is present as follows (do not enclose in code using \"```\"):\n\"\"\"\n**I. Case Scenario:**\n{{clinical_case}}\n{{physical_examination}}\n\n**II. Instructions:**\n1. {{test_instruction1}}\t\n2. ...\n\n**III. Questions:**\n\n{{test_topics}}\n\n**IV. Additional Notes:**\n- Duration time: {{test_duration}}\n- ...\n\"\"\"\nWith test_topics being: \"\"\"\n*{{topic_letter}}. {{topic}}:*\n\nQ{{question_number}}. {{question}}\n...\n\"\"\"\n\n#### Considerations ####\n- The clinical_case is a detailed, hypothetical patient condition for studying throughout the generated test. In addition to that, it is followed by a summarized physical examination table;\n- All test_questions should be unique and relevant to their clinical topic while focussing on your proposed clinical case study. The first topic comes to be \"Identification and Diagnosis\".\n\n[ PROFILE ]\nA regular student of medicine with fundamental medical knowledge and basic clinical practice. In particular, this profile seeks a comprehensive understanding of this cardiovascular pathology.\n- Topics: epidemiology in Portugal and etiology, detailed diagnosis and treatment protocols, risky complications, and rudimentary prophylaxis and prognosis.\n- Target Style: Correct medical terminology and a rigorous, engaged tone.\n",
