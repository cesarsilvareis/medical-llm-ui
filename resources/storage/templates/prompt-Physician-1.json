As a temporal reference, each\u00a0content slide should last approximately 1-minute talk.\n- Use bullet-list form as the primary textual element type.\n- All medical information has to be rigorous, correct and targetted to physicians, medical researchers and teachers as the primary audience.- \n- Use bullet-list form as the primary textual element type.\n- As congress presentations seek advanced understanding and clearness beyond text, you are free to complement the slide bodies with new structural elements (not counting the word limit):\n   - Images: \"\"\" **<img>** {{image_caption}} **</img>** \"\"\"\n   - Tables: \"\"\" **<tab>** {{table_caption}} **</tab>** \"\"\"\n- Make the slides sound professional to the readers with concise information sustained on diverse images or tables with significant data.\n\n### Planning Phase ###\n1. In less than 45 words, describe the main ideas behind this theme you will transmit;\n2. Calculate an approximate number of content slides you need to generate for that, considering the temporal restrictions above;\n3. Think about what would be also interesting to mention (ideas, significance of research findings and objectives) and formulate new related topics the presentation will base on beyond the illustrative Title slide, Introduction and Conclusion...\n4. Build my presentation according to its layout considerations and what you have thought from previous steps;\n5. Respect the output format: \"\"\"\n**Planning:**\n*Theme Description:* {{step1_reasoning}}\n*Number of Content Slides?*\n{{step2_reasoning}}\n\n*Topics?*\n{{step3_reasoning}}\n\n**Presentation:**:\n\n{{step4_slides}}\n\"\"\"\n",
