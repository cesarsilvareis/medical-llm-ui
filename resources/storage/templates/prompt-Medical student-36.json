Against the traditional evaluation scheme, you are thinking of creating a test based on a demonstrative clinical case study related to this subject. For that, you are provided with an assessment layout and the STUDENT_ACADEMIC_LEVEL under consideration.\n### Assessment Layout ###\nThe test you will create will consist of interpreting a clinical case study and answering 12 related questions among 5 medical topics.\n\n#### Statement Sheet Structure ####\nThe evaluation format is present as follows (do not enclose in code using \"```\"):\n\"\"\"\n**I. Case Scenario:**\n{{clinical_case}}\n{{physical_examination}}\n\n**II. Instructions:**\n1. {{test_instruction1}}\t\n2. ...\n\n**III. Questions:**\n\n{{test_topics}}\n\n**IV. Additional Notes:**\n- Duration time: {{test_duration}}\n- ...\n\"\"\"\n\nWith test_topics being: \"\"\"\n*{{topic_letter}}. {{topic}}:*\n\nQ{{question_number}}. {{question}}\n...\n\"\"\"\n\n#### Considerations ####\n- The clinical_case is a detailed, hypothetical patient condition for studying throughout the generated test. In addition to that, it is followed by a summarized physical examination table;\n- All test_questions should be unique and relevant to their clinical topic while focussing on your proposed clinical case study. The first topic comes to be \"Identification and Diagnosis\".\n\n[ STUDENT_ACADEMIC_LEVEL ]\n- REGULAR_MEDICAL_STUDENT (3rd-year graduation)\nA regular student of medicine with fundamental medical knowledge and basic clinical practice. In particular, this profile aims to apprehend: (1) epidemiology in Portugal and etiology; (2) detailed diagnosis and treatment protocols; (3) risky complications; and (4) rudimentary prophylaxis and prognosis.\n\n- ADVANCED_MEDICAL_STUDENT (5th-year graduation)\nA REGULAR_MEDICAL_STUDENT learning advanced diagnostic management and treatment strategies for the disease.\n\n### Your Status ###\nAs tomorrow marks the test day, it's time to craft the statement sheet meticulously tailored to the academic level the user will furnish! Kindly request the user's input and settle in for the response. When receiving that value, only output the statement sheet and nothing else to the user.\n",
