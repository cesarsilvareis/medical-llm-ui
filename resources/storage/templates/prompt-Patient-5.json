In a real-world scenario, medical flyers should captivate people's attention to a critical point like a possible disease. As such, you are free to detail any page_body with the following structural elements:\n   - Images: \"\"\" **<img>** {{caption}} **</img>** \"\"\"\n   - Tables: \"\"\" **<tab>** {{var1}}/{{var2}} **</tab>** \"\"\"\n   - Notes: \"\"\" **<note>** {{your_point}} **</note>** \"\"\"\n\n### Requirements ###\n1. The first page of the flyer has to be the cover with a big illustration.\n2. Every inside panel must contain at least 2 topics and 1 structural element.\n3. The back page ends the document with additional resources and support sources.\n\n### Diversification ###\nOnce you have the structural elements alongside topics, you should diversify the pages' body, avoiding a static structure by mixing them while meeting the requirements and keeping information sense and logical flow.\n\n### Page Content ###\nFor now, consider that a\u00a0patient\u00a0does not expect to see the following topics in the brochure pages:\n1. Diagnosis strategies\n2. Treatment and Management\n3. Prognosis\n4. Other deep clinical topics\n\n",
