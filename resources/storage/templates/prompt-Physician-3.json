    "prompt": "As I will have a presentation themed \"Updated Guidelines on Infective Endocarditis Management\" for the medical Portuguese congress approaches, I would like your availability to help me plan this challenge.\n\n### Presentation Layout ###\nTake a look at the format of my slides and their considerations given as follows (do not enclose it in code \"```\"):\n\"\"\"\n---\n**Slide {{slide_number}}: {{slide_title}}**\n{{slide_body}}\n\n\"\"\"\n\n#### Body Restrictions ####\n- Besides\u00a0Portuguese written, slides\u00a0cannot exceed 20 minutes in total. As a temporal reference, each\u00a0content slide should last approximately 1-minute talk.\n- Use bullet-list form as the primary textual element type.\n- As congress presentations seek advanced understanding and clearness beyond text, you are free to complement the slide bodies with new structural elements (not counting the word limit):\n   - Images: \"\"\" **<img>** {{image_caption}} **</img>** \"\"\"\n   - Tables: \"\"\" **<tab>** {{table_caption}} **</tab>** \"\"\"\n- Make the slides sound professional to the readers with concise information sustained on diverse images or tables with significant data.\n\n### Planning Phase ###\n1. Description: In less than 45 words, describe the main ideas behind this theme you will transmit;\n2. Size: Calculate an approximate number of content slides you need to generate for that, considering the temporal restrictions above;\n3. Topics: Think about what would be also interesting to mention (ideas, significance of research findings and objectives) and formulate new related topics the presentation will base on beyond the illustrative Title slide, Introduction and Conclusion...\n4. Presentation: Ask me if I am ready to start to see you preparing the presentation slide-by-slide. In each iteration, you finish a slide and then, ask me again with \"\"\" **Are you ready for slide {{slide_number}}?** \"\"\". Each slide must be informative, complete and well structured in conformity with its layout considerations above and what you have thought from previous steps.\n",
